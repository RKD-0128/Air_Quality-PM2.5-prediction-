# Air_Quality-PM2.5-prediction-
Air quality degradation is an alarming issue in metropolitan cities. Degraded air quality leads to adverse effects on human health leading to issues like respiratory diseases and even environmental dis-balance like acid rain and global warming, further degrading human health. Also, the data is changing according to weather changes and other factors, which our traditional algorithms may not handle properly. We proposed a method for implementing algorithms that works with real-time data of air quality prediction.

An air quality index (AQI) is used by the Government agencies to communicate to the public how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecasted to become. Public health risks increase as the AQI rises. Our project is intended to build and design a model which will predict the quality of air and PM 2.5 concentrations based on the historical data in particular locations allowing the government to be aware about the increasing pollution and act on it by taking necessary precautions.

# Tools
The Project is developed in python and we used the following cloud service:
> Google Colab

# Libraries

This Project needs python and uses the following libraries:
> Pandas

> Numpy
> Matplotlib
> Scikit-learn
> Seaborn
> Tensorflow

# Code
The Analysis Code file is saved in **data_analysis.py** for which we have used the dataset saved in file named **maninagar,-ahmedabad-air-quality.csv** and the prediction code is saved in **prediction.py** for which we have used the dataset saved in file named **fprojdata-final project data.csv**.

# Regression Models used in the project

Following Regressions are used:
> Linear Regression
> LASSO Regression
> Decision Tree Regression
> AdaBoost Regression
> K-Nearest Neighbor Regression
> Random Forest Regression

Out of all the regression, Random Forest showed the most accuracy.
